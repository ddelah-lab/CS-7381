For the implementation, we give the environment a 2-dimensional array of probabilities. The utility of a state is defined as the number of currently clean squares in the room. Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 100000 time steps. To do this, the agent needs to learn the probabilities with which different squares get dirty again. This is very tricky!"
